# Solution notes

## Focus 

- apart from dependencies upgrade, I decided not to implement the bonus features (apart from dependency upgrades) as 
I already exploded the timebox and I wanted to focus on testing, code quality and tools
- I didn't implement the following topics as they are trivial but could be time-consuming:
  - apidoc documentation and generation
  - using UUID instead of exposing IDs
  - using ORM, migrations or worrying about DB performance at all 

## Problem considerations

- it was not clear if request.json should have an entrypoint (like a command or API to import a full JSON file), so I 
just kept the service available and tests using the example file
- not all suggested collection methods were implemented (there is no function that would use "remove")
- it was not clear if separate APIs were needed for fruits and vegetables and another one returning a generic collection
of all produce, so I just created separate fruits and vegetable endpoints

## Developer tools

- I've updated to PHP 8.4, Symfony to 7.3 and PHPUnit to 12.2. I've also added phpstan (with level 8 checks) and 
php-cs-fixer with a PSR12 + custom style.
- added XDebug to the docker image and a helper Makefile

# 🍎🥕 Fruits and Vegetables

## 🎯 Goal
We want to build a service which will take a `request.json` and:
* Process the file and create two separate collections for `Fruits` and `Vegetables`
* Each collection has methods like `add()`, `remove()`, `list()`;
* Units have to be stored as grams;
* Store the collections in a storage engine of your choice. (e.g. Database, In-memory)
* Provide an API endpoint to query the collections. As a bonus, this endpoint can accept filters to be applied to the returning collection.
* Provide another API endpoint to add new items to the collections (i.e., your storage engine).
* As a bonus you might:
  * consider giving an option to decide which units are returned (kilograms/grams);
  * how to implement `search()` method collections;
  * use latest version of Symfony's to embed your logic 

### ✔️ How can I check if my code is working?
You have two ways of moving on:
* You call the Service from PHPUnit test like it's done in dummy test (just run `bin/phpunit` from the console)

or

* You create a Controller which will be calling the service with a json payload

## 💡 Hints before you start working on it
* Keep KISS, DRY, YAGNI, SOLID principles in mind
* We value a clean domain model, without unnecessary code duplication or complexity
* Think about how you will handle input validation
* Follow generally-accepted good practices, such as no logic in controllers, information hiding (see the first hint).
* Timebox your work - we expect that you would spend between 3 and 4 hours.
* Your code should be tested
* We don't care how you handle data persistence, no bonus points for having a complex method

## When you are finished
* Please upload your code to a public git repository (i.e. GitHub, Gitlab)

## 🐳 Docker image
